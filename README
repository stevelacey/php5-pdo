This branch is to demonstrate an example integration of php5-pdo into Symfony 1.3/1.4.

This setup has been implemented and tested on unix servers operated by the University of the West of England 11/2010.

The custom Doctrine_Connection is necessary to allow php5-pdo to sit alongside the existing PDO on the system, but allow for the use of _PDO's drivers, which the server lacks.
