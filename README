The purpose of these classes are to allow for the use of PDO in an environment which you don't have administrative access to and lacks PDO or respective drivers.

Obviously this code performs no way near as well as real PDO and it is recommended if you can to upgrade the relevant packages on the system, but should that option not be available this will hopefully be of use.

At present I've only updated and tested the MySQL driver, and it's still less than perfect (but at least working), the others remain in their original PHP4 compatible state, if you do update them then don't forget to fork and I'll happily merge back into this repository.

This code is based on classes taken from: http://www.phpclasses.org/package/2572-PHP-PDO-database-abstraction-interface-for-PHP-4.html
